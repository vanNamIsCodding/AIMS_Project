Sometimes to understand a word's meaning you need more than a definition; you need to see the word used in a sentence. At YourDictionary, we give you the tools to learn what a word means and how to use it correctly. With this sentence maker, simply type a word in the search bar and see a variety of sentences with that word used in its different ways. Our sentence generator can provide more context and relevance, ensuring you use a word the right way.
Whether it’s simple sentences for those just learning the English language or phrasing for an academic paper, this easy-to-use sentence generator will help you choose your words with confidence.

With our sentence examples, seeing a word within the context of a sentence helps you better understand it and know how to use it correctly. From long to short, simple to complex, this tool can assist you with how to use words that may have more than one meaning.
There are many types of sentences, all with different structures and complexities. In its most basic form, a sentence is made up of a subject and predicate, which is the verb and the words that follow. But no matter how simple or complex, a sentence consists of words. Words in a sentence are what make it come alive and make sense.

Understand how words are used within the sentence, no matter the structure, and get inspiration for writing your own sentence correctly with the help of these example sentences.
We get it. Learning the meaning of the many words that make up the English language can seem overwhelming. Take away the nerves and make it simple and easy to understand with the use of our sentence maker.

YourDictionary strives to make learning as stress-free as possible, no matter what your age or understanding is. And our sentence examples are no different.

We understand that sometimes the best way to truly understand a new concept is to see it used in an example. With the help of our useful tool, you can be one step ahead with grasping the complexity and workings of English vocabulary.

With an increased understanding of how words can be used, you can make your writing come to life with an arsenal of words of varying difficulties and meanings.

Simply type the word into the sentence generator and we’ll do the rest.
If you're visiting this page, you're likely here because you're searching for a random sentence. Sometimes a random word just isn't enough, and that is where the random sentence generator comes into play. By inputting the desired number, you can make a list of as many random sentences as you want or need. Producing random sentences can be helpful in a number of different ways.

For writers, a random sentence can help them get their creative juices flowing. Since the topic of the sentence is completely unknown, it forces the writer to be creative when the sentence appears. There are a number of different ways a writer can use the random sentence for creativity. The most common way to use the sentence is to begin a story. Another option is to include it somewhere in the story. A much more difficult challenge is to use it to end a story. In any of these cases, it forces the writer to think creatively since they have no idea what sentence will appear from the tool.

For those writers who have writers' block, this can be an excellent way to take a step to crumbling those walls. By taking the writer away from the subject matter that is causing the block, a random sentence may allow them to see the project they're working on in a different light and perspective. Sometimes all it takes is to get that first sentence down to help break the block.

It can also be successfully used as a daily exercise to get writers to begin writing. Being shown a random sentence and using it to complete a paragraph each day can be an excellent way to begin any writing session.

Random sentences can also spur creativity in other types of projects being done. If you are trying to come up with a new concept, a new idea or a new product, a random sentence may help you find unique qualities you may not have considered. Trying to incorporate the sentence into your project can help you look at it in different and unexpected ways than you would normally on your own.

It can also be a fun way to surprise others. You might choose to share a random sentence on social media just to see what type of reaction it garners from others. It's an unexpected move that might create more conversation than a typical post or tweet.

These are just a few ways that one might use the random sentence generator for their benefit. If you're not sure if it will help in the way you want, the best course of action is to try it and see. Have several random sentences generated and you'll soon be able to see if they can help with your project.

Our goal is to make this tool as useful as possible. For anyone who uses this tool and comes up with a way we can improve it, we'd love to know your thoughts. Please contact us so we can consider adding your ideas to make the random sentence generator the best it can be.

Trying to incorporate the sentence into your project can help you look at it in different and unexpected ways than you would normally on your own.

It can also be a fun way to surprise others. You might choose to share a random sentence on social media just to see what type of reaction it garners from others. It's an unexpected move that might create more conversation than a typical post or tweet.



It can also be successfully used as a daily exercise to get writers to begin writing. Being shown a random sentence and using it to complete a paragraph each day can be an excellent way to begin any writing session.
